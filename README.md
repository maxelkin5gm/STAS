# Control panel for automated warehouse (Automated rack and container warehouse)
Implementation of a control panel for an automated warehouse. The software allows you to use the warehouse in an automated mode. Namely, to select the desired positions and deliver to the destination.

The Arduino controller is connected to the mechanical part of the warehouse and controls it. In turn, the server sends commands to the controller. The web interface allows you to manage all this. This is how the control panel works.
